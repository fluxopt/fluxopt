"""Benchmarks over the bundled realistic reference systems (``fluxopt.benchmark``).

Unlike the archetypes in ``systems.py`` (which live in this directory and work
against any fluxopt version), these come from the installed package — so
comparing two branches is just running the suite on each (``uv run`` re-syncs
the editable install after a ``git switch``; see README.md, which also covers
``benchmem sweep`` for released versions).

Versions that predate ``fluxopt.benchmark`` skip this file (importorskip).
A quarter year keeps a multi-round pytest-benchmark run reasonable; the
full-year numbers come from ``python -m fluxopt.benchmark``.
