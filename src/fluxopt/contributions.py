"""Per-contributor effect breakdown, read off the program.

Every contribution the ledger sums is a named expression in
``math/program/``, declared with the entity it came from and reduced only
where ``effect_accounting`` adds it up. So the breakdown is not a second
implementation of the effect math that has to be checked against the first —
it is the same declaration, read one step before the sum.

Two views:

- **direct**: each contributor shows only what it directly emits. This is
  what the expressions give: the coefficients are bound as declared, and the
  ledger adds the cross-effects on top of what each effect is charged.
- **with cross-effects** (default): each contributor is charged the full
  priced-in cost, CO2 through to cost. ``reporting.yaml`` states each
  contribution once more with the ledger's own chained `share` applied, as
  ``priced_*``, so the breakdown and the ledger read one table.

The contributor axis is a presentation choice rather than model math: flows
and storages share one dimension, and a component-level cost is attributed to
the first flow its status governs, having no single natural flow of its own.
