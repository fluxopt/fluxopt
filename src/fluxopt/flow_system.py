"""``FlowSystem`` — the declarative top of the element layer.

A ``FlowSystem`` is an inert, validated description of a flow system: the
same lists you would pass to :func:`fluxopt.optimize`, gathered into one object
that round-trips to dict/YAML. It carries *structure* (components, effects,
config) and ``ProfileRef`` references to time-series; the actual series are
supplied at solve time via ``profiles`` (``system.optimize(profiles=...)``) and
resolved into arrays just before the model is built.

The FlowSystem has no modeling behavior of its own — ``.optimize()`` runs the existing
pipeline (:meth:`ModelData.build` → the math program). Declaration (the system)
and use (building/solving) stay separate.
