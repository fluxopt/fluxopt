"""fluxopt's math, and the engine that builds it.

Three layers: Elements -> ModelData -> this. The math is
:data:`~fluxopt.math.sources.PROGRAM`, a directory of YAML fragments that
mathspec composes into one spec, built and solved by
`specsolve <https://github.com/fluxopt/lpspec>`_;
:mod:`~fluxopt.math.sources` binds a ``ModelData`` to it, and the answer is
specsolve's own ``Result``.

There is no second implementation. ``model.py`` built the same math a second
time in linopy calls, and deleting it is what
``docs/design/lpspec-direction.md`` was written to argue for: the math is a
file now, so it is reviewed, diffed, typeset and extended as one.

specsolve and mathspec are pinned to commits — their language surface is
pre-1.0 and still moves, so an unpinned ref would let a ``uv sync`` change
what the program means.

One refusal is left, and it is a difference of formulation rather than a gap:
``PiecewiseConversion.method='lp'`` is linopy's tangent-line *relaxation*, and
this program has only the exact formulation, so it would answer a different
question. :class:`UnsupportedFeatureError` says so rather than quietly
answering it.
