"""The numbers a system binds, as an artifact.

fluxopt's math is a file. Its numbers were not — they were computed at every
solve and thrown away, which left the two halves of a solve with unequal
standing: a caller could read, edit and typeset the equations, then supply
data for a constraint of their own through a channel whose existing contents
were invisible to them.

:class:`Parameters` is the other half. It is what ``build_sources`` already
produces, given a name, a schema and a directory to live in — so
``system.math()`` and ``system.parameters()`` answer the same question about
the two halves, and ``(math, parameters/)`` is the whole problem.

**Derived, never authored.** The tables are persistable, not a writing
surface: the Leontief fold and the size pre-scaling have already dissolved
what the user declared into what the solver adds up, so an edit here is an
edit nobody can review. The authoring surfaces stay the element layer for
data and the program for math. See docs/design/parameters-as-artifact.md.
