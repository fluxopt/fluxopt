Both lanes answer with the same object, which is what lets the parity test
compare answers rather than shapes — and what makes deleting the linopy
builder a deletion rather than a migration.

The program is bound on the labels the element layer used, so the answer
already carries them. The work is a rename, one program variable to one
``Var`` name, and putting entities back in declaration order.
