    """Build *data* as a streaming program and solve it.

    Args:
        data: The model data. The same object the linopy backend consumes.
        objective: Effect id, or effect ids mapped to objective weights.
        solver_name: ``highs``, which ships with lpspec, or ``gurobi``, which
            needs lpspec's ``[gurobi]`` extra.
        solver_options: Forwarded to the solver verbatim, in *its own*
            vocabulary rather than linopy's (``{'mip_rel_gap': 1e-9}`` is
            HiGHS's own spelling).
        math: An edited program to solve instead of the shipped one — the
            model returned by :meth:`~fluxopt.flow_system.FlowSystem.math`,
            with whatever the caller added to it. It goes through validation
            and lowering exactly as a file does.
        dimensions: Labels for the dimensions *math* adds, as
            ``{name: labels}``.
        lookups: Data for the lookups *math* adds, as ``{name: frame}`` with
            the ``over`` dimension and the space its values are labels of,
            holding one row per label it maps and none for a label it does
            not.
        parameters: Data for the parameters *math* adds, as
            ``{name: frame}`` with the declared dims and a ``value`` column.

            The three are the language's own declaration blocks, and
            :class:`~fluxopt.math.parameters.Parameters` reports them under
            the same three names — so what a caller reads and what they supply
            use one vocabulary.

            None of the three may overwrite a name the program already binds:
            a caller who could silently replace ``rate_max`` could change the
            model without editing it.

    Returns:
        The same :class:`~fluxopt.results.Result` the linopy lane returns.

    Raises:
        UnsupportedFeatureError: If *data* uses a feature the program does not
            express yet.
        NoSolutionError: If the solve produced no primal solution — lpspec's
            own, so one class covers a sweep whichever lane ran.
